title: Usage with UI Frameworks
description: How to use @atlaskit/drag-and-drop with different UI libraries and frameworks
---

`@atlaskit/drag-and-drop` has been designed to be used with any UI library or framework.

This was a deliberate technical decision with a few benefits:

- We can be as close to the metal as possible to get fantastic performance
- We can support deferred behaviour attaching without needing to lean into any library specific abstractions
- We can have drag and drop between pieces of UI written in different UI libraries
