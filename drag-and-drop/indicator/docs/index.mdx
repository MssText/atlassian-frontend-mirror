# Drop indicator

When reordering draggable items within drop targets, a drop indicator is used to communicate the intended resting place of the draggable item. The orientation of the drop indicator should always match the direction of the content flow.

## Edge

Use `edge` to specify which edge of the drop target the drop indicator should be rendered on.

```
<DropIndicator edge="top">
  {({className}) => (
    <DropTarget className={className} />
  )}
</DropIndicator
```

## Gap

Use `gap` to specify the distance between each draggable item.

The line will be drawn at an offset of half this value, resulting in the line being drawn between draggable items.

```
<DropIndicator edge="right" gap={8}>
  {({className}) => (
    <DropTarget className={className} />
  )}
</DropIndicator
```
