# Drop indicator

When reordering draggable items within drop targets, a drop indicator is used to communicate the intended resting place of the draggable item. The orientation of the drop indicator should always match the direction of the content flow.

    Ensure that the parent element has non-static positioning.
    The drop indicator uses `position: absolute` so will be positioned relative
    to the closest ancestor with non-static positioning.
  </p>

    Generally you will want to add `position: relative` to the element you want to position the line against.

## Edge

Use `edge` to specify which edge of the drop target the drop indicator should be rendered on.

```
<div style={{ position: 'relative' }}>
  <DropIndicator edge="top" />
</div>
```

## Gap

Use `gap` to specify the distance between each draggable item.

The line will be drawn at an offset of half this value, resulting in the line being drawn between draggable items.

```
<div style={{ position: 'relative' }}>
  <DropIndicator edge="right" gap={8} />
</div>
```
