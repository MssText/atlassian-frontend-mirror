When reordering draggable items within drop targets, a drop indicator is used to communicate the intended resting place of the draggable item. The orientation of the drop indicator should always match the direction of the content flow.

<SectionMessage
  title="Absolute positioning"
>
  <p>
    Ensure that the parent element has non-static positioning.
    The drop indicator uses `position: absolute` so will be positioned relative
    to the closest ancestor with non-static positioning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Generally you will want to add `position: relative` to the element you want to position the line against.
  </p>

## Edge

Use `edge` to specify which edge of the drop target the drop indicator should be rendered on.

<Example Component={ClosestEdgeExample} />

## Gap

Use `gap` to specify the distance between each draggable item.

The line will be drawn at an offset of half this value, resulting in the line being drawn between draggable items.
