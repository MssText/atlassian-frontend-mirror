## Making an announcement

The `announce` function announces the provided message to assistive technology.

Internally, a single live region will be created and reused across function calls. The live region is created with `role="alert"`, corresponding to:

- `aria-live="assertive"` → messages will be announced immediately, interrupting any message currently being announced.
- `aria-atomic="true"` → messages will be read in full, even if the current and previous message share a substring.

```ts
import * as liveRegion from '...';

liveRegion.announce('Task "Clean dishes" moved to list "Doing" from "Todo".');
```

## Cleaning up the live region

The `cleanup` function will remove the live region created by `announce` from the DOM.

If a live region does not exist, no error will be thrown and nothing will happen. That means the function is safe to call optimistically.

```ts
import * as liveRegion from '...';

liveRegion.cleanup();
```
