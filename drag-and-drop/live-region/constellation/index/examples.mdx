## Announce a message

The `announce` function announces the provided message to assistive technology.

Internally, a single live region will be created and reused across function calls. The live region is created with `role="alert"`, equivalent to setting:

- `aria-live="assertive"`, meaning that messages will be announced immediately and interrupt any message currently being announced.
- `aria-atomic="true"`, meaning that messages will always be read in full.

```
import * as liveRegion from '@atlaskit/live-region';

liveRegion.announce('Task "Clean dishes" moved to list "Doing" from "Todo".');
```

## Cleanup live region
The `cleanup` function will remove the live region created by announce from the DOM.

If a live region does not exist, no error will be thrown and nothing will happen. This means that the function is safe to call optimistically.

```
import * as liveRegion from '@atlaskit/live-region';

liveRegion.cleanup();
```
