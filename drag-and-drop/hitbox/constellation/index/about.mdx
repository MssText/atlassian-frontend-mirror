description: An addon to extract collision information from a user's drag.
---

This package includes _addons_ and _utilities_ to extract additional information about the impact of the users current drag.

- [@atlasit/drag-and-drop-hitbox/closest-edge](/components/drag-and-drop/packages/hitbox/closest-edge) - detecting the closest edge (`"top", "right", "bottom", "left"`) for a _drop target_ being dragged over
- Trees (_coming soon_)
- `@atlasit/drag-and-drop-hitbox/types` - a way to import the types of this package without any implementation (includes the `Edge` type)
