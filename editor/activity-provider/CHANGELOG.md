# @atlaskit/activity-provider

## 2.0.0
### Major Changes

- [`71c78f8719`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/71c78f8719) - EDM-642 Use new ActivityProvider and it's going to be a replacement of the existing `@atlaskit/activity`. The new ActivityProvider will use the new platform API instead of talking to the old Activity Service API.
