Use section messages let a user know when:

- taking a particular action may have potentially destructive consequences
- they need to take action to keep moving through an experience
- there are connectivity or authentication issues

## Anatomy

1. **Icon and background color:** The icon and background color pairing indicates the message type and comes in the default styles for the message type.
2. **Title:** Titles should clearly and concisely indicate the purpose of the message.
3. **Description:** This should describe the issue and any action the user needs to take, if any. The message will grow along with the length of the description but should be as succinct as possible.
4. **Actions (optional):** One or more links that enable the user to act on the section message content.

## Content guidelines

- Titles should contain keywords that will immediately draw the user's attention to the issue.
- Description text should be clear, concise, empathetic and informative.
- Use active verbs to guide the user on the action they need to take.
