import ImageDefault from '../../examples/constellation/image-default';
import ImageThemed from '../../examples/constellation/image-themed';

## Appearance

### Default

Works exactly like a native `img` element. It will recognize and accept all `img` props.

<Example Component={ImageDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/image" />

### Themed

You can optionally provide an additional dark mode image source with `srcDark`. When provided, `srcDark` will automatically be displayed when in dark mode and `src` in all other cases.

If a theme hasn't been explicitly selected by the user, the `Image` component will also check for operating system preferences. If the user prefers dark, it will use `srcDark`. Please note that selecting a theme in Atlassian will override the operating system preference.

<Example Component={ImageThemed} packageName="@atlaskit/image" />
