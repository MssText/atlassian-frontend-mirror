## Basic

Grids are composed of a container `Grid` and child `GridItems`. These two elements work together to form the grid.

<Example Component={Grid} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />

## Nested grids

Grids can be composed together. When a grid is composed only the root grid applies margin. This means
that the whitespace of the inner grid will match the whitespace of the outer grid.

<Example Component={NestedGrid} packageName="@atlaskit/grid" />
