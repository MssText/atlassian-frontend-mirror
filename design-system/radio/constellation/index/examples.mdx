## Default

The default way to present a single option from a list.

In most situations where you want to present a list of mutually exclusive options, you will want to use a [radio group](/components/radio/radio-group/examples).

<Example Component={RadioDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/radio" />

## Complex Radio usage

There may be some situations where you are unable to directly stack the radio inputs vertically. In those situations, using individual `Radio` components rather than a `RadioGroup` may be more suited to your needs.

<Example Component={RadioInTable} packageName="@atlaskit/radio" />
