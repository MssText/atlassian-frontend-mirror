## Introduction

The overrides prop is an escape hatch for more granular customization of the checkbox component.
The prop is an object comprised of properties corresponding to specific customizable components in `@atlaskit/checkbox`.
Each of these properties are an object of one or more of the following properties:

```
{
  component: React.ComponentType
  // state here is any additional state the provided by the component
  cssFn: (defaultStyles, { tokens, ...state }) => CSSObject
  // props here are any dynamic values that the component passes down that might affect the returned attributes object
  attributesFn: (props: Record<string, any>) => Record<string, any>
}
```

For a more detailed look at the shape of this prop for `<Checkbox/>` and `<CheckboxIcon/>` please see the `<Checkbox/>` [prop documentation](/components/checkbox/code#props);
The goal of this prop is to provide a way for users to unlock targeted customizations of key components in the `@atlaskit/checkbox` package,
without having to shoulder unnecessary complexity.

## Customizing components using the overrides prop
There may be scenarios when `style` and `theme` customizations arenâ€™t enough to satisfy your use case.
For example you may want to add additional state logic to a component, or a more complex / alternative dom tree.
In these scenarios please leverage the `component` property of the overrides prop to switch out the default component provided by `@atlaskit/checkbox`
for your own custom component.

Below is an example of leveraging this property to switch out the default icons used within `@atlaskit/checkbox` for an alternative set.

<Example
  packageName="@atlaskit/checkbox"
  Component={CheckboxSwitchingIcons}
/>

## Passing custom props using the overrides prop

At other times, passing a property down to a specific dom element may be the only customization you need,
in these scenarios having to provide a custom component whole sale is unnecessary and time consuming. 
This is why `@atlaskit/checkbox` also provides an `attributesFn` for providing custom attributes to the underlying dom elements of customizable components.

Below is an example of us passing form and `data-testid` attributes to the rendered label element.

<Example
  packageName="@atlaskit/checkbox"
  Component={CheckboxCustomAttributes}
/>

## Applying CSS customizations using the overrides prop
There will be scenarios where `theme` isn't adequate for the type of style customizations your use case requires.
In these cases, `@atlaskit/checkbox` exposes more granular control of the application of CSS through a `cssFn` property specified in the passed in overrides object.
This is useful for scenarios where you want to augment how a particular theme token is being applied to your styles or if you have customizations
that the theme tokens do not support.

### Using the cssFn
The `cssFn` property on the overrides prop is a function of the following signature:

```
{
  IconWrapper: {
    cssFn: (defaultStyles, state) => {...}
  }
}
```

As it takes the default CSS styles as the first argument, spreading is an easy way to compose your desired new styles together with the default styles of the component:

```
const customIconWrapperStyles = (defaultStyles: any) => {
  return {
    ...defaultStyles,
    fill: 'green',
  };
};
```

Below is an example of using the `cssFn` to augment the transition styles of an instance of `@atlaskit/checkbox`

<Example
  packageName="@atlaskit/checkbox"
  Component={CheckboxCustomStyles}
/>
