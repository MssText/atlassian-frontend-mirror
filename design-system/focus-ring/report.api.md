 * __Use focus ring__
 *
 * The `useFocusRing` hook is designed to manage focus for the `FocusRing` in cases where the `FocusRing`'s visual application
 * and the element that takes focus, differ. See the `focus` prop of `FocusRing` for more information.
 *
 * @example
 * ```jsx
 * import VisuallyHidden from '@atlaskit/visuall-hidden';
 * import FocusRing, { useFocusRing } from '@atlaskit/focus-ring';
 *
 * const InteractiveComponent = () => {
 *  const { focusState, focusProps } = useFocusRing();

 *    <div>
 *      <VisuallHidden>
 *        <input {...focusProps} />
 *      </VisuallyHidden>
 *      <FocusRing focus={focusState}>
 *        <div role="button">Hello</div>
