  <p>
    For now, we recommend that only Atlassian employees use tokens and theming
    in production. We’ll post an update in the developer community when tokens
    are ready for adoption.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that tokens use a new version of the Atlassian color palette. Color
    values will not always match those imported from @atlaskit/theme/colors.
