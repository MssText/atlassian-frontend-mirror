## Default

The default form of a button, used for most cases. They are not impactful enough to represent the primary action in a container.

<Example Component={ButtonDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Appearance

### Primary

Use a `primary` button to call attention to an action on a [form](patterns/forms) or to highlight the strongest call to action on a page. Primary buttons should only appear once per container (not including the application header or in a [modal dialog](components/modal-dialog)). Not every screen requires a primary button.

<Example Component={ButtonPrimary} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Subtle

Use a `subtle` button with a `primary` button for secondary actions, such as â€œCancel".

<Example Component={ButtonSubtle} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Link

Use a `link` button to navigate to another page. These should open in the same window unless information may be lost (for example, when someone is filling out a form), or when the destination is an external site (for example, a knowledge base article).

<Example Component={ButtonLink} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Subtle link

Similar to a `subtle` button, but behaves like a `link` button. Use a `subtle link` button to avoid overwhelming the page with blue links.

<Example Component={ButtonSubtleLink} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Warning

A `warning` button appears before we request the user to take action, usually in anticipation of a significant change. These are found mostly in confirmation modals.

<Example Component={ButtonWarning} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Danger

The `danger` button appears as a final confirmation for a destructive action such as deleting. These are found mostly in confirmation modals.

<Example Component={ButtonDanger} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## States

### Disabled

Set `isDisabled` to disable a button when another action has to be completed before the button is usable, such as changing a text field value or waiting for a system response.

<Example Component={ButtonDisabled} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Selected

Set `isSelected` to indicate the button is selected.

<Example Component={ButtonSelected} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Loading

Set `isLoading` to indicate the button is loading. The button text is hidden and a spinner is shown in its place, while maintaining the width that it would have if the text were visible.

<Example Component={ButtonLoading} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Spacing

Buttons can have various spacing. Default spacing is used for most use cases, compact for tables and none for breadcrumbs.

<Example Component={ButtonPadding} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Full width

Buttons can be expanded to full width to fill its parent container.

<Example Component={ButtonFullWidth} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

## Button with icon

Buttons may include an icon before or after the text.

### Icon before

Display an icon before the text.

<Example Component={ButtonWithIconBefore} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />

### Icon after

Display an icon after the text.

<Example Component={ButtonWithIconAfter} packageName="@atlaskit/button" />
