## Usage
Flags messages appear at the bottom left of the screen and overlay any content.

There are 2 types of flag message: standard and bold.

Standard flag messages are for general, event-driven messages that are dismissible. For example, as notifications for recent activity. One common use case for standard flags is as a notification about recent activity. This allows people to easily jump into a conversation or activity feed to get a quick update. In these cases, an avatar is used instead of the icon.

Bold flag messages are non-dismissible and use color to indicate the type and severity of the message.

## Anatomy

1. **Icon (or avatar) and title:** Flag messages should always contain a concise title and an appropriate [icon](/foundations/iconography), [color](/foundations/color) (or user avatar).
2. **Message (optional):** Flag descriptions are restricted to five lines in length. If the text overflows, it truncates using an ellipsis.
3. **Actions (optional):** A maximum of two links that enable users to act on the flag's content.
4. **Dismiss:** Use to close the flag. This is for standard flags only.

## Best Practices
- Use the [color system](/foundations/color) guide the usage for flag messages, and keep a consistent visual language.
- When there are multiple flags, they will stack on top of one another with the most recent flag on top. When a user dismisses a flag, any older flags 'below' will come to the top. Careful consideration should be taken to take into account the ordering and priority of flags in the stack.
- Never use dismissible and non-dismissible flags in a stack as flags that automatically dismiss can do so and not be visible to the user.
- When a modal is active, flags should always be visible above the modal.

## Content guidelines

#### Warning
- Put yourself in the user's shoes.
- Make sure you're not talking about something that has already occurred (this should be an error message instead).

#### Error
- Avoid blame and accept if something is our fault - "we're having trouble connecting" rather than "you're having connection issues."
- Let the user know what's causing the error, rather than writing a general error message that works for a number of things.
- Be clear and conversational by thinking about how you might explain a technical error to your non-technical friends.

#### Success
- Messages that appear more frequently should have less wink and be more concise.
- Messages that appear after a bigger or more infrequent action can be more playful.

#### Information
- Say why it's important.
- Get right to the point.
- Based on the situation, you can add more "wink" to your message, but keep it clear and concise.
